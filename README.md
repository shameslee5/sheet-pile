General rule of the thumb: “the harder the soil, the stronger and stiffer sheet pile section should be used”. Driveability of a [sheet pile](https://haifusheetpiles.com.my/sheetpile/) section is a consequence of its cross-sectional properties (thickness, depth, and width), designed shape, length, grade, and the applied load.
